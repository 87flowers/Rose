# Rose ðŸŒ¹

</div>

Rose is an experimental work-in progress UCI chess and chess960 engine.

Rose is intended as an experimental ground for less popular engine techniques.
In particular, Rose has fast (AVX-512 accelerated) attack tables.

As Rose is currently under active development, it will likely not work in your environment.

Please await a 1.0 release.

Here are issues that will be addressed before a 1.0 release:

* Only supports Clang. (I will likely not fix this.)
* Only tested on Linux. (Windows testing will be done prior to a 1.0 release.)
* Only supports AVX-512 CPUs currently. (AVX2 support will be done prior to a 1.0 release.)
